# Task1

+ measurement: ACC, Recall, Percision, F1, ROC-AUC
+ baseline method: gkmSVM

This task can be devided to two parts:

1. Feature extraction from sequence.
2. Classification.

For feature extraction, consider:

* k-mer based method
    + native k-mer
    + gapped k-mer
* word embedding
* CNN
* RNN/LSTM/GRU
* Ensembled method

For classicication:

* Support Vector Mechine
* Tree based method
    + Random forest
    + Gradient boosting
* Neuron network
    + FFN + softmax
